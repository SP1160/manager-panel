## Features

-   Create - works in such a way that first the script opens a form, then the user fills in the data and clicks Submit. After that, the program checks if the data entered by the user already exists in the database. If the data are identical, the console will warn you that such data already exist and the program cannot add your data.
-   Edit - the script works in such a way that first it opens the form with the data of the line whose icon you clicked. Then the user changes the data and clicks Submit. If the user did not change the data the console will say so. If the user changed the data, but it is the same as what is already in the table, the console will display a warning about this. If the user tries to edit data that are already in the rental agreement, the form will not open and the console will display a message stating that the data cannot be edited while it is involved in the rental agreement.
-   Delete - works in such a way that by clicking on the delete icon in the desired row, the user can delete the data both from the database and from the page. If the user tries to delete the data, which are used in the rental contract, the console will say that it is impossible to delete data if they are used in the rental contracts.
-   Show - works in such a way that when you click on the icon to show the rental agreement, a page is generated with the agreement and the data inserted there from the line you clicked on.
